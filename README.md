# FrontEnd-Coding-Challenge


Create an app that lists all messages and their details from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
## Requirements

- Load the posts from the JSON API and populate the sidebar.
- Each Cell/Row height should fit according to the size of the content.
- The first 20 posts should have a blue dot indicator.
- Remove the blue dot indicator once the related post is read.
- Once a post is touched, its related content is shown in the main content area.
- The related content also displays the user information.
- Add a button in the navigation. It adds the current post to favorites.
- Each cell should have the functionality to swipe and delete the post.
- Add a button to the footer that removes all posts.
- Add a button to navigation that reloads all posts.
- Add a segmented control to filter posts (All / Favorites).
- Favorite posts should have a star indicator.
- Each post should be able to be added or removed from favorites with a click on the star.

## Extra points

- Cache all posts (Use the tool that you consider best to manage persistence).
- Add animations when the user deletes each/all posts.
- Show a list of comments related to each post. It should be located in the main content area.
- Add unit testing as you consider it.

## Considerations

- Create a repository (Github) and share it with the person who shared this technical test with you.
- Add a Readme.md file explaining how to run the application, the proposed architecture for development. Why is your solution better than another implementation? If I use third party libraries explain why. (advantages and disadvantages of your solution).
- You should support: iOS 15, Android API 30, React Native 0.66
